                <h2>Facts about Giraffes </h2>
                <p>
                    The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest
                    living terrestrial animal
                    and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species,
                    Giraffa camelopardalis,
                    with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due
                    to new research
                    into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur
                    coat patterns. Six
                    valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record.

                    The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like
                    ossicones, and spotted coat
                    patterns. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants,
                    primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot
                    reach.
